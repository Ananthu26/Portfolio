<h1 align="center">Portfolio</h1>

<p align="center">
I am currently developing a portfolio as part of The MEAN Stack Internship, with an initial focus on HTML and CSS. This portfolio will continue to grow as I integrate additional languages and frameworks throughout the internship. My goal is to create a polished, website-ready portfolio that will effectively showcase my skills, projects, and experiences to the public.
